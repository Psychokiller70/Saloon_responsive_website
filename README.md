🖼️Tips to Maximize the “Cool” Factor:
Use animated GIFs for live demos

Play with headings + emojis for visual punch

You can add SVG or PNG "3D" badges via <img> tags

Add "shimmer" or "animated gradient" images (place them in your repo and embed with <img src=...>)

For a full emoji list and ideas, see [GitHub emoji cheatsheets].
For custom 3D art, design in Figma/Photoshop and export as PNG, then add with:
